In this folder, please upload any comments on the experiment. See below for some ideas of what might be helpful to think about:

# What to look out for while piloting
1. Clarity of the instructions. Feel free to provide suggestions or discuss what was unclear.
1. Did you notice any typos in the instructions or stimuli?
    1. FYI: Not all of the experimental stimuli will be grammatical. You might see some sentences that appear to be typos.
1. How was the pacing of the RSVP task? Too fast, too slow, alright?
1. Were there any issues you noticed with the self-paced reading task?
1. What was your impression of the Sociolinguistic Survey? Were any questions confusing? How long did it take to complete the survey? 
1. Break Screens: Would you like to see a progress note on each break screen in the full experiment?
   1. In the EEG experiment, I know participants weren’t aware of where they were in the experiment. 
    1. “Break x out of x” in the bottom left corner?
1. Any other comments, questions, or suggestions that you have to improve the pilot experiment. 
1. Coloring and font size unfortunately is set. However, I can use more bold and italics on some of the screens.
